Algorithms let us think about computation **independently** of the limitations of a computer or programming language.
### Divide and Conquer

- 20 Questions: 50/50 splits, on average, perform better to narrow down choices
- **Binary Search**: Given a number guessing game, if we start with an upper bound, our strategy is to guess the middle of rolling "intervals." This effectively splits our guessing interval in half, over and over again.
### Graph Search

- [[ğŸ’§ Breadth First Search]] and [[ğŸšŸ Depth First Search]] are algorithms that are used to find paths in graphs that have cycles.
