title: ⚖️ Coulomb's Law
---

The amount of force between two electrically charged particles at rest. This force is called *electrostatic force* or *Coulomb Force*.

The formula reads as:
$$F=k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}$$
Where:
- $F$ is the **electric force**
- $k$ is the **Coulomb constant** = $8.988  (9.0)\times10^9 \frac{N \times m^2}{C^2}$
- $q_1, q_2$ are the **charges**
- $r$ is the **distance of separation**
