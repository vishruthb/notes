title: ⚡️ Electric Field

Fundamental law is $\vec{F} = q\vec{E}$, which can be rearranged to give the field $\vec{E}=\frac{\vec{F}}{q}$.

Unit of electric field is $\frac{N}{C}$.

Can find acceleration by beginning with Newton's second law of motion:
$$F = ma$$
With that, we can make the correlation that when substituted for the initial formula, we find:
$$ma=q\vec{E}$$

Thus,
$$a = \frac{q\vec{E}}{m}$$
Units also check out to be $\frac{m}{s^2}$.
