## Time vs. Space

- Need to consider tradeoffs to get more efficient solutions.
- I.e. If comparing two items, keeping track of what's been visited to minimize the number of inspections being done.
## Parallelism & Pipelining

- **Parallelism:** A strategy for solving problems more quickly by making progress on multiple different tasks simultaneously.
- **Pipelining:** A form of parallelism where tasks are solved faster by having multiple tasks simultaneously at various levels of completion (overlap).
## Caching

- Temporarily moving a piece of information to access it faster. 
- Provides a much more flexible way of dealing with certain resource tradeoffs.
## Order and Searching

- Fast to find an item in an already-sorted sequence, **if the sequence is sorted in a useful way.**
## Abstraction

- Help manage complex systems by breaking them down into understandable and well-defined tasks.
- Layers of abstraction: think Python being interpreted into machine code
- Doesn't always make a system slower, but makes it easier for maintenance and improvements.
## Interface

- APIs
- An **abstraction** that manages complexity by defining how to interact with a process while hiding how the process actually gets done.
